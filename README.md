This is a backup of the group project of my university course of Applied Data Mining. (Collaborate with Linda Chien, Megan Liu and Sirikorn Sillapapanich)

The purpose of this project is to apply several Machine Learning (ML) models to the stroke prediction dataset with multiple tools and platforms. Observing different ML model’s performance by various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall and F-score to find out the best values for this case.

The dataset we used is Stroke Prediction from Kaggle.

The four ML models this project has applied are Decision Tree, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, K means, and Apriori Algorithms. Since Python is one of the popular programming languages, it has been applied to all the algorithms. In addition, Orange and R have also been used to compare the model values.
